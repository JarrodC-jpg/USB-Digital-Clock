Press top or bottom button to turn off center lights

To set the time:
1. Press and hold the top button until center lights start blinking
2. Top button adjust the hour, bottom button adjust minuts
3. Press and hold top button to set time, the center lights will stop blinking
4. To back out of time set with out saveing press and hold the bottom button

*Note: The time currently gaines a few seconds a day resulting in about a 1 minute time loss over the course of a few days. Still need to squash that timing bug. If you have an idea of how to fix that, create a new branch and take a shot. If it fixes the issue we will merger it to the master.
